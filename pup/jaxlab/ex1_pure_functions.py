"""Exercise 1: write calculations that can be traced.

JAX first traces your Python into an array program, then compiles that program.
A traced value is a placeholder, so Python cannot ask whether it is positive.
Use array selection instead. Arrays are immutable; updates return new arrays.
A traced loop bound needs a JAX loop whose carried value keeps its shape.

Worked example (provided):
    def positive_part(values):
        return jnp.where(values > 0, values, 0)
    compiled = jax.jit(positive_part)
    compiled(jnp.array([-2., 3.]))  # [0., 3.]

Broken starting ideas to repair:
    if x > 0: return x
    values[index] = value
    for index in range(count): total += index

You will hit exactly these three errors in Stage 3.
See docs/02_jax_for_robotics.md. Each function has a test with traced inputs.
Keep input shapes stable between calls to reuse the compiled program.
