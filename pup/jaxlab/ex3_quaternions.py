"""Exercise 3: MuJoCo uses WXYZ, not ROS XYZW.

A quaternion q_wb rotates a body-frame vector into the world frame.
Its inverse rotates a world-frame vector into the body frame.
Unit quaternions have length one. q and -q describe the same rotation.
Our gravity observation is a direction [0,0,-1], not acceleration -9.81.

Worked example (provided):
    q_wb = jnp.array([1., 0., 0., 0.])
    vector = jnp.array([0., 0., -1.])
    # Identity orientation leaves vector unchanged.

Use the cross-product identity:
    temporary = 2 * cross(q.xyz, vector)
    rotated = vector + q.w * temporary + cross(q.xyz, temporary)
For a unit quaternion the inverse negates xyz and preserves w.
Compose inverse and rotate to express world gravity in the body.
Do not construct Euler angles: their singularities add unnecessary work.
The tests compare random unit quaternions with MuJoCo's own C routine.
See docs/02_jax_for_robotics.md for a worked 90-degree example.
